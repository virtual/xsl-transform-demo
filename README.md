# XSL Transform Demonstration

## About
This demonstration shows the power of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). The image.xml shows the code that a user would typically manage. It is simple and straight forward. The template-matches.xsl finds this table and transforms into complex code to provide a highly-customized HTML output. 

## To run
```
npm install
npm start
```
## Extra
This demonstration mimics the functionality of the OU Campus CMS provided by OmniUpdate.
